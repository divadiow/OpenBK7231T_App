# OpenOPL1000 platform bring-up

This is the first real-port OpenOPL1000 target. It starts the normal OpenBeken runtime rather than a separate OpenOPL1000 web-console shim.

Current scope:

- Opulinks OPL1000 A2 SDK patch entrypoint
- real OpenBeken `Main_Init()` task
- STA-only Wi-Fi bring-up through the OPL1000 HAL
- hardcoded test Wi-Fi defaults for bring-up: `test` / `1234abcd`
- normal OpenBeken HTTP/command path, trimmed to fit the A2 M3 patch image

Still intentionally incomplete:

- GPIO/PWM/ADC implementation
- persistent flash/config storage
- OTA write implementation
- SoftAP, because OPL1000 does not support SoftAP

## UART logging

For bring-up, v9 forces APS/debug UART to the same pins that show the ROM/bootloader text:

```text
IO0 = APS/debug UART TX
IO1 = APS/debug UART RX
115200 8N1
```

Expected early marker if the M3 patch reaches application init:

```text
[OpenOPL1000] Main_AppInit_patch reached; APS/debug UART is IO0/IO1 @115200
```

If you only see the ROM/bootloader text and never this marker, the M3 patch has not reached `Main_AppInit_patch()`.

## Opulinks pack-ready output

The GitHub build emits a pack-ready ZIP using the names expected by the Opulinks GUI packer:

```text
OpenOPL1000_pack_ready_<version>.zip
├─ PatchData.txt
├─ opl1000_m0.bin
└─ opl1000_app_m3.bin
```

Use those exact files in the OPL1000 Download Tool Pack tab:

```text
Script:  PatchData.txt
M0 Bin:  opl1000_m0.bin
M3 Bins: opl1000_app_m3.bin
```

v9 uses the root SDK `FW_Pack` M0/PatchData pairing, not the demo TCP_Client pairing. This matches the root SDK patch layout and includes the extra M3/M0 hardware patch words from `FW_Pack/PatchData.txt`.

## v11 Wi-Fi bring-up note

v11 keeps the v10 real OpenBeken runtime path and changes only the OPL1000 Wi-Fi glue.
The v10 log showed the scan table but no association, with only about 728 bytes free after Wi-Fi init. The SDK demo path allocates a full `wifi_scan_list_t`, which is too large under the real OBK runtime. v11 avoids that heap allocation by using a fixed small scan-record buffer, copies the matched BSSID/channel into the STA config, and removes the extra no-op OPL1000 Wi-Fi keeper task to recover heap.
